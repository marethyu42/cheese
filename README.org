* Cheese
This was a very small and silly common lisp project to "cheesify" sentences for a joke, born from a three hour bus ride on a school trip.

Or perhaps I should say:

Chis chas cha chery chall chand chilly chommon chisp choject cho "cheesify" chentences chor cha choke, chorn chom cha chee chour chus chide chon cha chool chip.

Credit to someone else for the split string function, but the rest is all my own code.
